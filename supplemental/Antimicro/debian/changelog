antimicro (2.5) all; urgency=medium

  * Fixed packaging the Windows version so the program will work on
      Windows XP again.

  * Delay rendering of flashing buttons. This helps improve controller
      responsiveness when the main window is not hidden.

  * Reduced the size of written profiles. Only changed values are
      now stored in profiles.

  * Updated German translation provided by phob and Leonard Koenig.

  * Allow a profile to be listed as the final argument on the command line.
     Ex: antimicro ~/antimicro-profiles/profile.xml.

  * Added diagonal distance support for distance slots for Standard
     mode on Sticks and DPads. This was necessary for some modifier assignments
     to work properly. The best example is for assigning walking in Half-Life 1.

  * Allow generated events to be sent to a different X display than the
      application is running on. This change was mainly done to better work
      with SteamOS. AntiMicro can be run via ssh with X tunneling in order
      to configure profiles on one system but the program will send events to the
      X display that is running Steam and games.

  * Auto Profile support has improved for SteamOS. Application grabbing can
      now be done while in the SteamOS BPM Session. Steam BPM can be grabbed as
      well.

  * Only show active or soon to be active slots for buttons in the main
      window. The text displayed on the buttons will update when a
      new zone has been reached due to using slots such as distance or hold.

  * Allow no profile to be assigned to an application for an Auto Profile entry.
      This means that the program will chose an empty profile when the application
      for that Auto Profile entry has focus. This will help with disabling AntiMicro
      for applications that already have controller support.

  * Controller Mapping dialog now stops processing events until all elements
      have been released on a controller.
